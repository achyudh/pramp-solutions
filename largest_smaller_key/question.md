# Largest Smaller BST Key
Given a root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a number num, implement an efficient function findLargestSmallerKey that finds the largest key in the tree that is smaller than num. If such a number doesnâ€™t exist, return -1. Assume that all keys in the tree are non-negative.

Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

### Constraints:
